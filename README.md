## Travelling Salesman Problem

**Description:** Finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city.

**Solution Algorithms:**
**Exact Algorithms:** Dynamic Programming, Branch and Bound, Linear Programming.
**Heuristic Algorithms:** Nearest Neighbor Heuristic [O($n^2$)], Christofides Algorithm.
